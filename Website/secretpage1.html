	<p> Did you know that crows love to gossip with each other? In fact, they even tell other crows about people they like (or don't!) This means that the other crows in a murder will learn to recognize you as well. They are also smart enough to recognize faces, even just by gossiping.<br> <!-- wanted more space between text --><br> Sounds fun right? <br> <br> ...right? <br> <br> Then, you find out that during the winter, crows will often gather in the hundreds and sometimes thousands and often gossip with others. Think you've only angered one crow? No. That gossip will spread far and wide, potentially to thousands of other crows who are now also angry at you. <br> <br> <img id="crow" src="images/crowonpowerline.jpg" title="&copy;Copyright 2025 Abigail Brownlee" alt="A crow sitting on a powerline" style="width: 504px; height: 672px;"> <br><br> Want more fun facts?
